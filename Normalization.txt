#Normalization Question

a) {borrower_id, requestdate, repayment_date}

b) Normalizing based on the relational dependencies:

      borrower_id -> address, name
      borrower_id, requestdate -> loanamount
  
   Therefore, the BCNF would look like this:
   
      Repayment1(borrower_id, address, name)
      Repayment2(borrower_id, requestdate, loanamount)
      Repayment3(borrower_id, requestdate, repayment_date, repayment_amount)
